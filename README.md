<h2>Process 🚀</h2>
The project began with the idea of creating a platform that helps connect creatives and clients, making it easier to showcase and discover inspiring projects. The design process started in Figma, focusing on a clean, minimalist layout to emphasize the content. React was used for the frontend to ensure flexibility, and Framer Motion was incorporated to provide interactive animations. The backend, built with Next.js, ensures server-side rendering and routing.
